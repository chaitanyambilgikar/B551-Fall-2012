# An A* search to morph one word of
# length n into another word of length n,
# changing one letter at a time and using
# real words along the way.
#
# Invocation:  "wordgame.py word1 word2"

# Author: Kris Hauser (hauserk@indiana.edu) 8/22/2012

"""This is the wordgame module.  It defines an search for the change-one-
letter-at-a-time game.  The goal of the game is to get from word A to word B,
changing only one letter at a time and creating a new (actual) word at every
step.  For instance, to change from "mare" to "colt":
-mare
-more
-mole
-molt
-colt

This module is an executable script.  To run the program and solve an
instance of the game, execute the following at the command line:
> wordgame.py startword goalword

On Windows, you may need to execute with the "python" command:
> python wordgame.py startword goalword"""
