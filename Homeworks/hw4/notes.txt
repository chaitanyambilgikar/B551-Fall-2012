so we are predicting the topic of a file given the contents of the file (the word and their frequency), and the label of the file.
in the function train() in Naive Bayes Classifier: 
examples: Contains a dict of all words in each file + label of that file
fname contains the"EXISTS_" part and fval contains "True/False"

prob (a|b) = prob(b|a)

2d: So, we have taken  a tree T and made a Training set D based on this set. Now when we run the Training algorithm on this set, it will generate a tree.
We need to check:
As the size of D
